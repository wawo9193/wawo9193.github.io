#Welcome to my portfolio Readme! ðŸš€

This portfolio page uses the *Gatsby* open source framework. A great tool  
to create static pages.  
  

If you would like to run the program yourself:
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the top directory using `cd`
- Run command `gatsby develop` and open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

The portfolio can be found hosted at this [link]: https://wawo9193.github.io  

Thanks for checking it out!
