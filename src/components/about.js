                Hi, my name is Wayne and I am a rising senior at CU Boulder. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have interned as a Software Engineer at Panasonic and worked as a Computer Science Course Assistant 
                at CU Boulder.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I enjoy challenging myself with a variety of programming projects and I enjoy movies, 
                cooking, basketball, frisbee, cycling, and hiking.
            </p>
            <p> I am searching for an entry level software engineering opportunity starting Summer, 2021, so please reach out 
                if you would like a resume and/or are interested in learning more about me!
            </p>
